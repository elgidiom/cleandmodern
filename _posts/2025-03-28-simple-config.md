# How to use theme
Just copy the _config.yaml file, edit with your preferences and add

remote_theme: elgidiom/cleanmodern

# _config.yaml

There isn't much to configure in the main config file, but here's a brief description:

    description: The main headline on the homepage.

    subtitle: The text displayed below the description.

    profile_img: Your profile image, shown in the top-left corner of the page.

    paginate: The number of posts per page.

# Simple post

Besides the title, layout, date, or categories, the most important element of this theme is the image. It appears prominently as the cover of the post.

Make sure to add an image to every post to maintain the visual style of the theme.

# Start using
Yep, just start using, this or other, no more excuses to start writing.
